From 2007 onwards, data also include the proportion of residents retrenched by the public sector. \u200bFrom 2010, the coverage is further expanded to include residents on term contracts who were terminated prematurely because of redundancy.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that data on re-entry into employment are cohort-specific. Two different cohorts of workers laid off could yield a different re-entry rate depending on the profile of the workers involved. Also, the data based on administrative records do not capture workers who enter into self or informal employment or undergo training while looking for job.", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-12-09T12:29:52+08:00", "coverageStart": "2000-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2023-06-30T08:00:00+08:00", "frequency": "quarterly", "sources": ["Ministry of Manpower"], "managedBy": "Ministry of Manpower", "childDatasets": ["d_a37f60ec80295a2ac7c48cb099a1c125", "d_d419d8e9f55934556d946a76acda6908", "d_281f3d6089007c84a17cd833b73541fe", "d_0e704d169645f900c7bb8d260e9106eb", "d_6672d361571ae908361fc0460bfb795d"]}, "datasetMetadata": [{"datasetId": "d_a37f60ec80295a2ac7c48cb099a1c125", "createdAt": "2016-04-11T23:19:38+08:00", "name": "Rate of Re-entry Into Employment, Quarterly", "collectionIds": ["697"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-12-09T12:12:46+08:00", "managedBy": "Ministry of Manpower", "coverageStart": "2000-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2024-09-30T08:00:00+08:00"}, {"datasetId": "d_d419d8e9f55934556d946a76acda6908", "createdAt": "2016-04-11T23:21:15+08:00", "name": "Rate of Re-entry Into Employment Occupational Group Prior To Retrenchment, Quarterly", "collectionIds": ["697"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-12-09T12:29:52+08:00", "managedBy": "Ministry of Manpower", "coverageStart": "2000-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2024-09-30T08:00:00+08:00"}, {"datasetId": "d_281f3d6089007c84a17cd833b73541fe", "createdAt": "2016-04-11T23:20:36+08:00", "name": "Rate of Re-entry Into Employment by Educational Attainment, Quarterly", "collectionIds": ["697"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-12-09T12:22:58+08:00", "managedBy": "Ministry of Manpower", "coverageStart": "2000-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2024-09-30T08:00:00+08:00"}, {"datasetId": "d_0e704d169645f900c7bb8d260e9106eb", "createdAt": "2016-04-11T23:20:09+08:00", "name": "Rate of Re-entry Into Employment by Age, Quarterly", "collectionIds": ["697"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-12-09T12:17:27+08:00", "managedBy": "Ministry of Manpower", "coverageStart": "2000-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2024-09-30T08:00:00+08:00"}, {"datasetId": "d_6672d361571ae908361fc0460bfb795d", "createdAt": "2016-04-11T23:21:36+08:00", "name": "Rate of Re-entry Into Employment by Sex, Quarterly", "collectionIds": ["697"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-12-09T12:25:24+08:00", "managedBy": "Ministry of Manpower", "coverageStart": "2000-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2024-09-30T08:00:00+08:00"}]}, "errorMsg": ""}
