Mangroves not only provide valuable ecosystems services such as coastal erosion protection, water filtration and the areas for fish and shrimp breeding, they also harvested as building materials and are used as medicine. Seagrass beds provide feeding and nursery grounds for many organisms, such as dugongs and juvenile fish. They also anchor sediments, protect shorelines from erosion, remove nutrients and help control coastal water quality. However, these habitats are also the most vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and experienced a dramatic decline. They can be affected or degraded by oil pollution and water sedimentation due to shipping activities and coastal reclamation.\r\n\r\nTo protect and preserve the coastal habitats, it is necessary to monitor the status of habitats regularly. In order to achieve that, a map with detailed classification of the habitats plays an important role in the understanding, monitoring and aid in the decision making process for an effective management of the coastal habitats. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this study is to generate a large scale habitats map of Singapore using high resolution satellite imagery.", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T15:05:08+08:00", "frequency": "ad-hoc", "sources": ["National Parks Board"], "managedBy": "National Parks Board", "childDatasets": []}, "datasetMetadata": []}, "errorMsg": ""}
