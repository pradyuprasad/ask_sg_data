As Singapore continues to develop as a hub for international voice traffic, including transit and regional traffic in our published statistics will provide a more holistic picture of the vibrancy and growth of the entire international telephone services market in Singapore. \r\n\r\nThus, this figure includes total retail outgoing international call minutes as well as transit minutes. For comparison purposes, figures from previous years will also be adjusted accordingly. This change has been applied retroactively from Jan 2001. Further, starting from Jan 2001, traffic from other service providers such as ISR operators has also been included. Since Jul 2004, IDA has also expanded on the reporting of international telephone services to include all Service-Based Operators (SBO), resulting in a marked increase in the minutes reported from Jun 2004. Part of the increase is also due to monthly traffic fluctuations.", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T15:09:12+08:00", "coverageStart": "1999-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2019-05-31T08:00:00+08:00", "frequency": "monthly", "sources": ["Info-communications Media Development Authority"], "managedBy": "Info-communications Media Development Authority", "childDatasets": ["d_f13d2ab739ff5785bfd00d39ef28352c", "d_f8be6bfdacc48ea2a04d11de2e73ddc6"]}, "datasetMetadata": [{"datasetId": "d_f13d2ab739ff5785bfd00d39ef28352c", "createdAt": "2018-01-09T13:20:48+08:00", "name": "Total Number of Outgoing Retail International Telephone Call Minutes(Including Transit)", "collectionIds": ["238"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T15:07:45+08:00", "managedBy": "Info-communications Media Development Authority", "coverageStart": "1999-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2019-05-31T08:00:00+08:00"}, {"datasetId": "d_f8be6bfdacc48ea2a04d11de2e73ddc6", "createdAt": "2016-04-08T19:25:14+08:00", "name": "Total Number of Outgoing Retail International Telephone Call Minutes", "collectionIds": ["238"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T15:09:12+08:00", "managedBy": "Info-communications Media Development Authority", "coverageStart": "2004-07-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2019-05-31T08:00:00+08:00"}]}, "errorMsg": ""}
