Data on the number of Sub-sale and Resale units excludes en-bloc sale units and are collated from records submitted to Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore for stamp duty payments from 1Q2015. Prior to 1Q2015, Sub-sale and Resale data were compiled from caveats lodged to the Singapore Land Authority. As the latter (i.e. lodgment of caveats) is voluntary, caveats account for about 80 to 90% of all sub-sale and resale transactions. Hence, please note that data from 1Q2015 may not be directly comparable to figures in the previous quarters.", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-10-30T16:46:46+08:00", "coverageStart": "1999-10-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2023-06-30T08:00:00+08:00", "frequency": "quarterly", "sources": ["Urban Redevelopment Authority"], "managedBy": "Urban Redevelopment Authority", "childDatasets": ["d_7c69c943d5f0d89d6a9a773d2b51f337"]}, "datasetMetadata": [{"datasetId": "d_7c69c943d5f0d89d6a9a773d2b51f337", "createdAt": "2016-09-08T18:16:47+08:00", "name": "Private Residential Property Transactions in the Whole of Singapore, Quarterly", "collectionIds": ["1658"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-10-30T16:46:46+08:00", "managedBy": "Urban Redevelopment Authority", "coverageStart": "1999-10-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2024-09-30T08:00:00+08:00"}]}, "errorMsg": ""}
