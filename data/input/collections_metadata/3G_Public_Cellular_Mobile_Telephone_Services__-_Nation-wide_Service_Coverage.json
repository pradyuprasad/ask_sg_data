Service coverage is determined by signal strength. The availability of service coverage is the ability of a cellular network to achieve the minimum signal strength of at least -100dBm. Under IDA's 3G Public Cellular Mobile Telephone Service (\"PCMTS\") QoS framework, mobile operators are required to achieve Nation-Wide Outdoor Service Coverage of >99%. In order to better measure the end users' experience*, IDA has used mobile handsets to collect the signal strength sample readings for all service coverage indicators starting from Q2 2013.", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T14:21:57+08:00", "coverageStart": "2013-04-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2016-06-30T08:00:00+08:00", "frequency": "monthly", "sources": ["Info-communications Media Development Authority"], "managedBy": "Info-communications Media Development Authority", "childDatasets": ["d_0822082bfcc8f34e16b35bf4e0ff8260"]}, "datasetMetadata": [{"datasetId": "d_0822082bfcc8f34e16b35bf4e0ff8260", "createdAt": "2016-04-12T22:13:00+08:00", "name": "3G Public Cellular Mobile Telephone Services  - Nation-wide Service Coverage", "collectionIds": ["193"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T14:21:57+08:00", "managedBy": "Info-communications Media Development Authority", "coverageStart": "2013-04-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2016-06-30T08:00:00+08:00"}]}, "errorMsg": ""}
