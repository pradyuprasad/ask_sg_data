It includes persons who are mainly or partially engaged in R&D. The Survey\u2019s reporting convention for the headcount of those engaged in R&D is the number of persons as at the last day of the one year reporting period.\r\n\r\nOne full-time equivalence (FTE) unit may be thought of as one person-year. A person who spends 30% of his time on R&D and the rest on other activities during the one-year reporting period should be considered as 0.3 FTE. If a fulltime R&D worker is employed for only six months during the one year reporting period, this results in a 0.5 FTE\r\n\r\nR&D manpower comprises the three occupation groups defined and described below: researchers; technicians; and other supporting staff. Researchers are further sub-classified as follows:\r\n\r\n* Research scientists and engineers (RSEs) comprise the researchers, excluding the fulltime postgraduate research students, who hold formal qualifications at the university degree level. RSEs are classified into three subcategories according to the highest level of the formal qualifications: PhD; master degree; and bachelor degree.\r\n\r\n* Non-degree researchers comprise the researchers, excluding the full-time postgraduate research students, who hold formal qualifications below the university degree level.\r\n\r\n* Full-time postgraduate research students (FPGRSs). \r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to https://www.a-star.edu.sg/News-and-Events/publications", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T14:50:32+08:00", "coverageStart": "2010-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2018-12-31T08:00:00+08:00", "frequency": "annual", "sources": ["Agency For Science, Technology and Research"], "managedBy": "Agency For Science, Technology and Research", "childDatasets": ["d_9bad05d1afb13f6a11c243fd65f1d0f1"]}, "datasetMetadata": [{"datasetId": "d_9bad05d1afb13f6a11c243fd65f1d0f1", "createdAt": "2016-10-08T01:08:44+08:00", "name": "Research and Development Manpower Full Time Equivalence by Sector", "collectionIds": ["6"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T14:50:32+08:00", "managedBy": "Agency For Science, Technology and Research", "coverageStart": "2010-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2018-12-31T08:00:00+08:00"}]}, "errorMsg": ""}
