There may also be one-person\r\nhouseholds, where a person lives alone in a single housing unit. The household\r\nis equated with the housing unit and there is usually one household per housing\r\nunit. Subtenants or maids dwelling in the same housing unit as the lessee(s) or\r\nregistered tenant(s) do not constitute part of the household.\r\n\r\nType of Family Nucleus:\r\n\r\n* Nuclear family refers to either:\r\n  (i) a married couple with or without children; or\r\n  (ii) a family consisting of immediate related members, without the presence of a married couple, e.g. one parent only with unmarried child or children.\r\n* Extended nuclear family comprises a nuclear family with one or more relatives who, by themselves, do not form a nuclear family.\r\n* Multi-nuclear family refers to a family comprising two or more nuclear families.\r\n* Non-family based households refer to:\r\n  (i) single-person households (a person living alone who could be single,\r\nwidowed or divorced); or\r\n  (ii) unrelated or distantly related persons staying together.\r\n", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T15:04:36+08:00", "coverageStart": "2008-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2018-12-31T08:00:00+08:00", "frequency": "other", "sources": ["Housing & Development Board"], "managedBy": "Housing & Development Board", "childDatasets": ["d_e31c9070e0b1363584683b81d984bfa7", "d_b553c9286f58ba96ef0ee1088743da52"]}, "datasetMetadata": [{"datasetId": "d_e31c9070e0b1363584683b81d984bfa7", "createdAt": "2016-06-30T17:01:17+08:00", "name": "Type of Family Nucleus by Flat Type", "collectionIds": ["180"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T15:04:36+08:00", "managedBy": "Housing & Development Board", "coverageStart": "2008-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2018-12-31T08:00:00+08:00"}, {"datasetId": "d_b553c9286f58ba96ef0ee1088743da52", "createdAt": "2016-06-30T17:00:51+08:00", "name": "Type of Family Nucleus by Ethnic Group", "collectionIds": ["180"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-06-06T14:55:43+08:00", "managedBy": "Housing & Development Board", "coverageStart": "2008-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2018-12-31T08:00:00+08:00"}]}, "errorMsg": ""}
