These figures are based on resale flat transactions recorded for the quarter, and sorted by town and flat type.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n* The data excluded transactions that may not accurately reflect the market price, i.e. resale of part shares, resale between related parties, cases under the Conversion Scheme, resale of terrace flats, converted flats, and HUDC flats.\r\n* The figures are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars.\r\n\"na\"  indicates no resale transactions in this particular town and flat type. \r\n \"-\" refers to cases where there are less than 20 resale transactions in this particular town and flat type. Hence, median prices are not shown as they may not be representative. \r\n", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-11-14T16:15:30+08:00", "coverageStart": "2007-04-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2023-06-30T08:00:00+08:00", "frequency": "quarterly", "sources": ["Housing & Development Board"], "managedBy": "Housing & Development Board", "childDatasets": ["d_b51323a474ba789fb4cc3db58a3116d4"]}, "datasetMetadata": [{"datasetId": "d_b51323a474ba789fb4cc3db58a3116d4", "createdAt": "2016-06-11T00:22:49+08:00", "name": "Median Resale Prices for Registered Applications by Town and Flat Type", "collectionIds": ["157"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-11-14T16:15:30+08:00", "managedBy": "Housing & Development Board", "coverageStart": "2007-04-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2024-09-30T08:00:00+08:00"}]}, "errorMsg": ""}
