Indices from \r\n1Q1990 to 3Q2014 are re-scaled using a factor of 100 (new index in 1Q2009) / 138.3 (original index in 1Q2009) multiplied on the original index level to derive the re-based index level for the respective quarters. Due to rounding, there could be some differences in the quarterly price change compared to the RPI series before re-scaling.", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-10-25T18:28:38+08:00", "coverageStart": "1990-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2022-09-30T08:00:00+08:00", "frequency": "quarterly", "sources": ["Housing & Development Board"], "managedBy": "Housing & Development Board", "childDatasets": ["d_14f63e595975691e7c24a27ae4c07c79"]}, "datasetMetadata": [{"datasetId": "d_14f63e595975691e7c24a27ae4c07c79", "createdAt": "2015-07-07T18:22:54+08:00", "name": "HDB Resale Price Index (1Q2009 = 100), Quarterly", "collectionIds": ["152"], "format": "CSV", "lastUpdatedAt": "2024-10-25T18:28:38+08:00", "managedBy": "Housing & Development Board", "coverageStart": "1990-01-01T08:00:00+08:00", "coverageEnd": "2024-09-30T08:00:00+08:00"}]}, "errorMsg": ""}
